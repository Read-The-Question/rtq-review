# RTQ Review Content Web

Internal Next.js application for reviewing RTQ paper content directly from the
active `rtq-content` checkout. Unlike Review Markdown Web, this application does
not consume generated Markdown. Paper content is always read-only; review
outcomes use one configured database or Google Sheets destination while comments
and product-wide findings use the shared review database.

The application currently provides collection and file browsing, full nested
paper presentation, five-axis runtime tag filters, independent question and
answer content-RAG filters, rendered and raw content views, allowlisted
canonical paper assets, Google Sheets outcome submission, local append-only
review comments, and a separate product-wide finding inbox. A filter-aware left rail links directly to every visible
question, subquestion, and sub-subquestion. The read-only `allTopicsToml`
collection exposes the complete one-way projection across every active tag.

Authored `PaperList` wrappers render directly in question, answer, working,
formula, and tip Markdown. The optional `listStyleType` uses the shared review
contract and browser-native CSS markers; raw source retains the authored
wrapper. Unwrapped ordered and unordered lists default to `decimal` and `disc`.

Authored `PaperTable` wrappers use the same strict property vocabulary,
defaults, semantic header transformations, and presentation layouts as RTQ web.
Invalid attributes or table structures surface as preparation notes, while the
raw source retains the authored wrapper. Raw GFM tables use the same visual
defaults without claiming explicitly authored configuration.

The paper index also links to a dedicated read-only view of the canonical
`packages/papers/scripts/papers/lib/model/macros.toml`. That page treats the
file as one review document and shows every macro's source and rendered
expansion without paper review controls.

Its direct-TOML KaTeX macro path and current semantic-colour conformance are
recorded in the canonical
[RTQ KaTeX Semantic Colour Architecture](https://github.com/Read-The-Question/rtq-web/blob/develop/apps/web/docs/architecture/design-system/katex-semantic-colours.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.19.0 and pnpm 10.15.1 from the workspace root
- A sibling `../rtq-content` checkout, or `RTQ_CONTENT_ROOT` set to a complete
  `rtq-content` Git root
- The local `review-api` service at `http://localhost:4567`, or
  `RTQ_REVIEW_API_BASE_URL` set to its server-only URL, when the outcome
  destination is `google-sheets`

`RTQ_REVIEW_OUTCOME_DESTINATION` selects exactly one outcome writer. It accepts
`database` (the default) or `google-sheets`. The application never dual-writes;
set it to `google-sheets` to use the retained Review API path for compatibility
or rollback testing. The paper-page masthead reports the active destination
once; individual question review panels do not repeat it.

`RTQ_REVIEWER` sets the short reviewer identity sent with outcomes and recorded
with comments; it defaults to `ap` and accepts letters, numbers, dots,
underscores, and hyphens.

## Local use

From the `rtq-review` workspace root:

```bash
pnpm review-content-web:dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3001`.

The paper index reads the current working tree on each refresh. A selected paper
uses a stable route shaped as `/papers/<collection>/<source-relative-path>`.

## Live source behavior

The index enumerates every supported collection on each request, so additions,
removals, and renames appear after a page refresh. It keeps only paper summaries
in a process-local cache and uses each file's filesystem fingerprint to reparse
changed metadata; unchanged paper bodies are not repeatedly parsed. The first
index request after a server restart rebuilds this disposable cache directly
from TOML. No generated Markdown or durable index is involved.

A paper route is dynamic and reads the selected TOML directly for every server
request. While a paper remains open, returning focus to the tab or making a
hidden tab visible checks only that selected file—there is no polling and no
corpus rescan. If its content hash changed, the current rendered view remains
available and a banner offers a controlled refresh. Temporarily invalid TOML,
deleted or moved files, and failed checks have separate retryable notices.

Development and production builds use the same behavior. In development, edit
the content checkout and return to the review tab to trigger the selected-file
check. In production, the Node.js process must be able to see the same local
checkout; each process maintains its own disposable index-summary cache.
Dimensional and RAG filtering operates entirely on the already loaded paper in
the browser and does not read TOML or contact Google Sheets.

## Review controls

- Combine tags within any of the five dimensions and filter question and answer
  content-RAG states independently. The shared URL preserves the complete
  filter scope across refreshes, along with the active matching question.
- Peer-review outcome filters allow every outcome to be selected even when its
  current count is zero. Multiple outcomes on one side use OR, so reviewers can
  select both the current and intended next outcome before changing a request.
  **Reset** in that band clears all question and answer outcome selections while
  preserving content-RAG and dimensional filters.
- Use **Clear all** to reset both state facets, all five tag dimensions, and the
  active question while retaining unrelated display parameters.
- Use the simple display switches to show or hide workings and answers,
  dimensional tags, raw TOML values, Question review, and Answer review. The
  review sides are independent, so answer-only and question-only layouts are
  supported. Display preferences stay in local browser storage and existing
  combined review-panel preferences migrate to the two switches.
- Use the persistent **Simple review** switch to choose between **Looks good**,
  **Make a change**, and **Reset**, or the complete descriptive request set.
  Detailed mode adds **Change Complete**, **Block it**, and **Coming
  Soon**. The interface never requires reviewers to interpret internal PR
  codes. Reset clears only the state-scoped request in the configured
  destination and never removes SQLite feedback.
- The **Review target** selector persists the chosen Question or Answer side in
  local browser storage, so quick-review actions keep the same target after a
  refresh.
- Authored `<PaperSmall>...</PaperSmall>` supplementary text renders as a
  semantic native `small` element at a restrained relative size, including
  inline maths, without acquiring footnote behaviour.
- Rendered workings follow the production RTQ hierarchy: formulas and tips use
  labelled rows, later methods have their own divider, and authored
  `WorkingSection` stages retain their titles and connected side rail. Hidden
  stages remain absent from the rendered view but are still inspectable through
  **Raw source**.
- Use **Show previous feedback** to reveal immutable feedback from RAG states
  other than the current state; it is off by default. Each feedback region
  reports current and previous counts even when history is hidden.
- Use **Global finding** when an observation requires work across the review
  content product rather than feedback on the selected question. The composer
  requires only the finding; product scope is fixed and the current paper,
  question node, side, source version, reviewer, and submission identity are
  captured automatically. Submission closes the composer and does not add a
  marker, count, or finding list to the paper.
- Use the Previous/Next controls or `J`/`K` (`Alt` + arrow keys also work) to
  move through matching top-level question trees. The left question rail is
  built from that same filtered result and links to every displayed hierarchy
  level.
- All TOML and assets remain read-only. The asset route exposes only question
  images, manual working/answer images, and generated long-division SVGs.

## Review persistence

Question and answer outcomes use the exclusive destination selected by
`RTQ_REVIEW_OUTCOME_DESTINATION`. In the default `database` mode, they are
stored by UUID, side, and current canonical RAG state in the shared review
store; a reload displays only an exact current-state match. Reset clears only
that match. In `google-sheets` mode, the existing local `review-api` forwarding,
sheet routing, and TOML-backed display remain unchanged. Both modes retain the
same live identity and content-state validation before writing.

Both destinations accept only the canonical actionable requests: `PRG`,
`PRCR`, `PRCC`, `PRBD`, and `PRCS`. Retired aliases and outcomes are rejected at
the application boundary. A missing request is the `PRNS` default; the UI
represents that state through Reset rather than submitting `PRNS` as another
transition trigger.

Comments never call `review-api`. They are appended through Drizzle to
`<rtq-review>/database/review-content.sqlite`. Every question, subquestion, and
sub-subquestion uses its own UUID and review side for feedback. Collection,
paper path, and `rtq-question-id` are verified submission context but are not
persisted comment identity. Nested nodes inherit only the corresponding
question or answer RAG state from their containing top-level question.
Current-state comments appear against their exact node by default; **Show
previous feedback** also reveals earlier-state history. Feedback uses a
prominent full-width treatment below its stable Add Comment form, so appended
history does not move the composer farther down. All comments are read-only
after creation, with no edit, delete, or reset route. The main SQLite database
is versioned with this repository so feedback can be read from other machines;
its journal, WAL, and SHM sidecars remain ignored.

Global findings use a separate `global_review_findings` model and are never
loaded with paper comments. New rows start as `todo`. A roadmap or Jira
integration can read the active inbox with `GET /api/review/findings`, then mark
one consumed with `PATCH /api/review/findings` and the JSON body
`{"id":"<finding UUID>","processedBy":"<identity>"}`. Processing records
`processedAt` and `processedBy`, changes the status to `processed`, and removes
the row from subsequent active-inbox responses. There is intentionally no Jira
URL field or paper-context finding history.

## Checks and production build

```bash
pnpm --filter rtq-review-content-web format:check
pnpm --filter rtq-review-content-web lint:check
pnpm --filter rtq-review-content-web types
pnpm --filter rtq-review-content-web test
pnpm --filter rtq-review-content-web database:tracking:check
pnpm --filter rtq-review-content-web build
```

With the dev server running, the representative live-content route smoke test
is available as:

```bash
pnpm --filter rtq-review-content-web test:browser
```

## Acceptance walkthrough

Use mocked Review API responses for this walkthrough; do not submit a test
outcome to the production Google Sheet.

1. Open one canonical paper and one derived paper, and confirm their raw values
   and allowlisted paper assets come directly from the content checkout.
2. Select tags in two dimensions, confirm the visible set is reduced using OR
   within each dimension and AND across dimensions, then add independent
   question and answer RAG-state filters.
3. Copy the filtered URL, refresh, and confirm the filter scope is restored.
   Use **Clear all**, then reopen the copied URL to prove clear and restore
   independently.
4. Submit a mocked question or answer outcome and confirm the success state is
   visible without changing the source TOML.
5. Append feedback to a question or nested question, refresh, and confirm it
   remains attached to that exact UUID at the current top-level RAG state.
6. Change the current state, confirm the earlier feedback is hidden, then turn
   on **Show previous feedback** and confirm the prior-state feedback appears
   in its original context.
7. Open **Global finding** from a selected question, confirm the product scope
   and source context are prefilled, submit one finding, and confirm no finding
   indicator appears on the paper. Read it through `GET /api/review/findings`,
   process it through `PATCH /api/review/findings`, and confirm it no longer
   appears in the active response.
